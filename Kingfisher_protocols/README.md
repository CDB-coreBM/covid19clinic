One working unit is composed by 4 multidispensing robots divided in 3 different stations named A, B1, B2, and C. Each of the stations perform different actions as described below:


- **Station A**: This station does a sample setup. Original samples are distributed in 4 racks of 24 samples each. The samples are redistributed in a 96 deepwell plate and a control reactive is added to each well.

- **Station B1**: Plate filling
- **Kingfisher**: RNA extraction procedure using magnetic microbeads
- **Station B2**: Sample preparation
- **Station C**: The qPCR plate is prepared by adding 5µl of the sample from the elution plate and 20 µl of a custom mastermix.
