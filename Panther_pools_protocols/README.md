**Documentation in progress**


One working unit is composed by 1 OT2 named Station A and a Panther robot.
Stations letters define a OT2 robot with a certain combination of pippettes attached, meaning the protocols can be run in the same robot. Each station performs different actions as described below:

- **Station A**: This station does a sample setup. Original samples are distributed in 4 racks of 24 samples each. The samples are redistributed in a 96 deepwell plate and a control reactive is added to each well. This station creates pools of samples and generates a file with the relation pool-samples. Every resulting tube can be fed to Panther.
- **Panther**: RNA extraction procedure and thermocycler
