Current global pandemic due to the SARS-COVID19 have struggled and pushed the limits of global health systems. Supply chain disruptions and scarce availability of RNA extraction kits have motivated worldwide actors to do research on virus detection systems.

The NGO ***COVIDwarriors*** made a donation to multiple hospitals in Spain to automatize the PCR testing of SARS-cov2 by equiping them with opensource programmable robots, developed by the US company ***Opentrons***. They also collaborated in the installation and setup by providing one engineer.
The [CORE biologia molecular](http://cdb.hospitalclinic.org/laboratorios/laboratorio_core_bm/en_index/) from ***Centre de Diagnòstic Biomèdic (CDB)***, within the ***Hospital Clínic de Barcelona*** have developed an automated method to extract RNA using these opensource robots. This methodology does not rely on the use of any commercial kits, as it implements a custom protocol using commonly available reactives. [cite original protocol here]. These robots will prepare the already inactivated samples for their analysis with a qPCR equipment, *Polymerase Chain Reaction*.
