This methodology does not rely on the use of any commercial kits, as it implements a custom protocol using commonly available reactives. [cite original protocol here]. These robots will prepare the already inactivated samples for their analysis with a qPCR equipment, *Polymerase Chain Reaction*.

One working unit is composed by 4 multidispensing robots divided in 3 different stations named A, B, and C. Each of the stations perform different actions as described below:

- **Station A**: This station does a sample setup. Original samples are distributed in 4 racks of 24 samples each. The samples are redistributed in a 96 deepwell plate and a control reactive is added to each well.

- **Station B**: RNA extraction procedure using magnetic microbeads and transfer to a 96 well elution plate .

- **Station C**: The qPCR plate is prepared by adding 5µl of the sample from the elution plate and 24.6µl of a custom mastermix.
